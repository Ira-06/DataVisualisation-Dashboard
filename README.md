# Data Visualization Dashboard with Streamlit

## Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python framework for creating interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users to explore and visualize datasets through dynamic charts, tables, and interactive widgets. It is designed to be user-friendly, customizable, and deployable for data analysis tasks.

## Features
- Interactive visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib.
- User input widgets (sliders, dropdowns, file uploaders) for real-time data filtering.
- Support for various data formats (CSV).
- Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.
- Easy deployment to Streamlit Cloud or other hosting platforms.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- A virtual environment (recommended)

# Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Prepare your dataset**:
   - Place your data files (e.g., `data.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
   - Update the `app.py` file to point to your dataset if needed.

## Usage
1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard**:
   - After running the command, a browser window will open automatically, or you can navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
   - Use the interactive widgets to filter data, select visualization types, and explore insights.

3. **Example**:
   - Upload a CSV file through the dashboard's file uploader.
   - Select a chart datatype (e.g., Date, City, Temperature) from the dropdown menu.
   - Adjust input fields to filter the dataset dynamically.
